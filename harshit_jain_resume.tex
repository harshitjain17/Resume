\textbf{Software Engineering Intern, Research Associate} \hfill May $2022$ - Present\\
Materials Research Institute (MRI), The Pennsylvania State University \hfill \textit{University Park, PA}
 \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep -3pt {}
     \item Contributed to the development of DMR-FIRST Instrument Tool (NSF-funded project), a full-fledged search engine for researchers across the U.S. to locate signature research instruments at their nearest location
     \item Implemented front-end architecture using React.js to design $50+$ latest user-facing features with $100\%$ accuracy (tested using JEST) and built reusable components and front-end libraries for continuous development
     \item Tested and optimized $20+$ REACT components for the best performance across every device and browser
     \item Integrated MS SQL Server relational database which currently deals with $500+$ instruments and $18+$ tables
     \item Saved weeks of development efforts by integrating leverageable modular code by using popular REACT libraries such as Material UI, improving the efficiency by approximately $40\%$
     \item Developed and tested Python scripts automating the process to retrieve data from various sources, manipulate and analyze the data, filter out irrelevant data, look up similar data in the server, import it into the server, and handle errors gracefully
     \item Collaborated and networked effectively with team members at each step of the design process to accomplish the sprint goals 
     \item \underline{Utilized:} Python, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, MS SQL Server, RESTful APIs, Git, HTML/CSS, JIRA, Office 365
